      <div>
        Iâ€™m Sam Friedman, a versatile, motivated problem solver from Baton
        Rouge, LA. <br/><br/>Throughout internships, undergrad courses in computer science
        and entrepreneurship, and my career, I have learned to appreciate the
        design thinking process. Whether collaborating with start ups fueled by
        LEAN thinking or contributing to more structured projects anchored by
        agile workflows, I prioritize strategy, efficiency and longevity when
        designing and implementing a solution. <br/><br/>I typically use JavaScript,
        ReactJS, CSS and HTML for frontend development. <br/><br/>For backend development,
        maintenance, continuous deployment and continuous integration, I often
        turn to AWS Amplify and GitHub. <br/><br/>When analyzing data, I frequently
        leverage PL-SQL as well as Python. <br/><br/>I developed this site with a combination of
        the full stack tools mentioned above.
