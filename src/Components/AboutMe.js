          My name is Sam Friedman, and I'm from Charlotte, NC. I decided to make
          this website as a portfolio and to practice some different layouts.
          I grew up playing computer games in the early 2000s, and I wanted this site to feel nostalgic. This first style is inspired by the old MS Paint aesthetic.

          I grew up in Charlotte, NC. What began as a love for building legos
          and constructing puzzles quickly evoled into a passion for problem
          solving.

          In highschool, I was elected president of the Math and Science Honors
          Societies. Outside of school, I was busy training with a competitive
          rock climbing team, where I was recruited to coach younger climbers.
          It was through these early responsibilities that my leadership and
          teamplaying skills began to develop.

          I attended UNC Chapel Hill, where I took an Intro to Programming
          course. I dove into the world of computer science, and left with a BS
          in Computer Science and minor in Entrepreneurship.

          While at UNC, I joined an environmental sustainability club, where I
          held a leadership position dedicated to research, development and
          strategy. Over three summers, I interned with three startups across
          diverse industries. I climbed with UNc's rock climbing club, and my
          friends and I won a cash prize at a start up competition.
