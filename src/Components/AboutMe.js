          My name is Sam Friedman, and I'm from Charlotte, NC. I decided to make
          this website as a portfolio and to practice some different layouts. I
          grew up playing computer games in the early 2000s, and I wanted this
          site to feel nostalgic. This landing page is inspired by the old MS
          Paint aesthetic.

          What began as building legos and constructing puzzles quickly evoled
          into a passion for problem solving. Paired with a love of technology,
          it was inevitable I would dive into the world of programming.

          In highschool, I was elected president of the Math and Science Honors
          Societies. Outside of school, I was busy training with a competitive
          rock climbing team, where I was recruited to coach younger climbers. I
          have been climbing for over a decade, and my favorite adventures are
          on the edges of mountains.

          I attended UNC Chapel Hill, where I took an Intro to Programming
          course. I dove into the world of computer science and left with a BS
          in Computer Science, minor in Entrepreneurship, and a passion for coding.

          While at UNC, I held a leadership position with an environmental
          sustainability club. Over three summers, I interned with three
          startups across diverse industries - one of which involved living abroad. I climbed with UNC's rock climbing
          club, and my friends and I won a cash prize at a start up competition.
